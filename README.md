# GPU-Accelerated Dual Gradient Projection Algorithm for Embedded Linear Model Predictive Control

This repository contains a GPU-accelerated implementation of the **Gradient Projection Algorithm for Dual (GPAD)** for solving embedded **Linear Model Predictive Control (MPC)** problems. Our approach leverages parallel computation on GPUs to achieve significant speedups compared to a sequential CPU implementation. 

This work is based on our research, which has been accepted for presentation at an upcoming conference.

## üöÄ Features
- **GPU-accelerated first-order optimization** for real-time embedded MPC applications.
- **Comparison with a CPU implementation** to evaluate computational performance.
- **CUDA-based parallelization** of the GPAD algorithm.
- **Optimized memory management** to enhance efficiency on embedded platforms.

## üìñ Background
Model Predictive Control (MPC) is widely used in embedded systems for real-time decision-making under constraints. The GPAD method is a first-order gradient-based approach that efficiently solves the dual problem of MPC formulations. By offloading computations to a GPU, our implementation reduces solution time, making MPC more feasible for resource-constrained embedded systems.
